In this study, we used a public dataset from the Building Data Genome project [1]. The Building Data Genome project has collected data from whole-building electrical meters. Hourly energy consumption data from March to May 2015 of five different buildings were analyzed in this study. We used five different buildings:

data of UnivDorm_Prince.csv -> this file contains Hourly energy consumption from University Dormitory building that we used in this study
data of UnivLab_Christy.csv -> this file contains Hourly energy consumption from University Dormitory building that we used in this study
data of UnivClass_Abby.csv -> this file contains Hourly energy consumption from University Dormitory building that we used in this study
data of Office_Abigail.csv -> this file contains Hourly energy consumption from University Dormitory building that we used in this study
data of PrimClass_Jaden.csv -> this file contains Hourly energy consumption from University Dormitory building that we used in this study
